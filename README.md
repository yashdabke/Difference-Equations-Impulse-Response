- The impulse response of a system is the output of the system when the input is an impulse, δ(t), and all initial conditions are zero.
- The impulse response is an especially importantproperty of any LTI system.
- We can use it to describe an LTI system and predict its output for any input. To understand the impulse response, we need to use the unit impulse signal.

- Given the system equation, we can find the impulse response just by feeding x[n] = δ[n] into the system.
- If the system is linear and time-invariant , then we can use the impulse response to find the output for any input, using a method called convolution.
